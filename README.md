## About this Project

This project is based on **Insurance Domain**.

Imagine a situation where an Insurance Company is receiving **tons of request** from its cutomer for their **claims**. In such situation they dont have much time to go through each and every application for checking if its a **false claim or not**.

Main focus is to reduce the workload by **20-30%** and focus on customers or other queries.

Using power of Machine Learning algorithms following project titled **Insurance Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning** was able to be sucessfull.
